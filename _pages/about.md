I am a Computer Science student in Purdue University’s accelerated BS/MS program, specializing in Machine Learning. Currently in my final year of the Bachelor’s and first year of the Master’s, I am on track to complete both degrees within four years.

I am primarily interested in machine learning, where I have gained significant practical experience as part of my studies. Additionally, I have recently developed an interest in computer graphics, particularly in the simulation of dynamic elements like water and cloth, which excited to explore further.
